Hell, Todd cleaned so much rock off the upper half on his ascent, I'm not even sure there's any rock at all left up there! It's probably a new route now and needs to be renamed and regraded. Anyway, if you do decide to do this death trap, I mean future classic, be careful what you pull on. And for Pete's sake, please wear a helmet (especially while belaying), and don't let anyone hang out under it while you're climbing!!! Ok, disclaimer aside, the roof pull on this thing is actually fun! And it is tall for the area. If nothing else, get on it for the experience!
