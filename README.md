# Redpoint

Redpoint is an application that serves to replace the traditional climbing guidebook. Utilizing the OpenBeta API,
Redpoint pulls climbing data related to users queries from the homepage. After that, users can access all the data they
need for a day at the crag including area and route descriptions, local weather, and user comments on routes.
Additionally, users can log in to create new comments, as well as add their ascents to their personal logbook.
